My app aims to help reduce teen and student stress by serving as a positive outlet to relieve anxiety. It helps bring awareness to the user's mental state/health. The "Emotion Entries" feature encourages users to reflect on how they feel and to examine what is happening in their life, helping users practice mindfulness. Chill Pill's "Take a Breather" feature guides users through a breathing exercise which provides them with many benefits associated with conscious breathing. "Game On" contains relaxing games to ease the brain of its worries. The games include "Positive Pops," a satisfying bubble pop game where each pop is followed by positive affirmations, and "Calming Coloring," a classic and creative activity that focuses stressful energy into art. Chill Pill also offers a feature called, "Enjoy the Sights." It is a collection of relaxing scenes that mentally transports the user somewhere else. "Cosmic Chill," "Underwater Unwind," and "Beach Breeze" all include gentle music and soothing animations that calm users senses and allow them to have a peaceful time to think and destress. The user is free to explore any of these features throughout the app as long as they completed their daily "Emotion Entry" allowing for full access.

# Inspo ✌️

Being a teen student myself, I noticed that my friends and peers would always talk about the same thing: stress. Going into harder classes and juggling activities, from learning to drive to planning for clubs, had started to affect the way I viewed stress and my mental state. The shuffle of tasks challenged the importance that I placed on my mental health. It felt surreal learning how detrimental poor mental health can be and how it has become one of the leading causes of teen death. Of course, something as drastic as emotional distress cannot be "solved" overnight, but as people who have the ability to move towards change, it is our responsibility to take steps towards improving the world around us and the health of its people. Chill Pill was created as a step towards a better world.
